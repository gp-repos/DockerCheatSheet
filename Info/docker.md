# Docker

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

Using Docker, you can run and manage applications in a standardized, isolated environment on your own computer or in the cloud. This makes it easier to develop and test applications, as well as deploy them to production environments.

With Docker, you can run multiple applications on the same host without them interfering with each other. This is because each container runs in its own isolated environment, with its own system libraries and dependencies. This makes it easy to run applications that might have different system requirements on the same host.

Overall, Docker makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications by providing a standardized and isolated environment for them to run in.

## Docker image

A Docker image is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime. It is used to package an application's code and all of its dependencies in a single object, which makes it easy to deploy and run the application in any environment.

Docker images are built from Dockerfiles, which are text files that contain instructions for building a Docker image. These instructions include information such as the base image to use, the dependencies to install, and any other customization needed to create the image.

Once a Docker image is built, it can be pushed to a registry, such as Docker Hub, where it can be stored and shared with others. Images can be pulled from the registry and run on any machine that has Docker installed, making it easy to distribute and deploy applications.

## Docker container

A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime.

Docker containers are built from Docker images, which are lightweight and portable packages that contain all the code, libraries, and dependencies needed to run an application. When you run a Docker container, it runs the code and all of the dependencies within the container, isolating the application from the host system and other containers.

Docker containers are a key component of Docker, a popular open-source containerization platform that allows you to build, run, and deploy applications in a consistent and reliable manner across different environments.

To run a Docker container, you can use the `docker run` command. This command pulls the desired image from a registry, if it is not already present on the host system, and creates a new container based on that image. The container is then started and the application within it is executed.

Docker containers offer several benefits, including the ability to package and distribute applications consistently, run applications in any environment, and isolate applications from one another and from the host system. They make it easy to deploy and run applications, particularly in a microservices architecture where multiple applications can be run in separate containers and managed as a group.

## Docker file

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It is a simple script that specifies the base image to use, the dependencies to install, and any other customization needed to create the image.

A Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image, which is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime.

Here is an example of a simple Dockerfile:

    FROM python:3.7-slim
    
    COPY . /app
    WORKDIR /app
    
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    CMD ["python", "main.py"]

This Dockerfile uses the Python 3.7 slim base image and installs the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file. It then sets the command to run the main.py script when the image is run as a container.

To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, you can use the `docker build` command. This command reads the instructions in the Dockerfile and creates an image according to those instructions. Once the image is built, it can be pushed to a registry and shared with others, or it can be run on any machine that has Docker installed.

## How to install Docker on Linux

To install Docker on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

Update the package manager index:

     sudo apt-get update

Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

    sudo apt-get install -y \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg-agent \
        software-properties-common

Add the Docker GPG key:

    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Add the Docker repository to your system:

    sudo add-apt-repository \
       "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
       $(lsb_release -cs) \
       stable"

Update the package manager index again:

    sudo apt-get update

Install Docker:

    sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

Verify that Docker is installed and running correctly:

    sudo docker run hello-world

This should pull and run the `hello-world` image and print a message indicating that the installation was successful.

## Some Docker history

Docker was first released in 2013. It was developed by Solomon Hykes while he was working at dotCloud, a cloud hosting company. Docker was initially developed as an open-source project to build and deploy applications more efficiently, and it quickly gained popularity due to its simplicity and ease of use.

In 2014, Docker Inc. was formed to support the development and evolution of Docker, and the company has since played a significant role in the growth and adoption of Docker and container technology.

Today, Docker is a widely used and well-established technology that is used by companies and organizations of all sizes to build, run, and deploy applications in a consistent and reliable manner across different environments. It is an important tool in the toolkit of many developers and DevOps professionals, and it has had a major impact on the way applications are built and deployed.
