# Docker

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

Using Docker, you can run and manage applications in a standardized, isolated environment on your own computer or in the cloud. This makes it easier to develop and test applications, as well as deploy them to production environments.

With Docker, you can run multiple applications on the same host without them interfering with each other. This is because each container runs in its own isolated environment, with its own system libraries and dependencies. This makes it easy to run applications that might have different system requirements on the same host.

Overall, Docker makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications by providing a standardized and isolated environment for them to run in.

## Commonly used Docker commands:

Here is a list of some of the most commonly used Docker commands:

|Command|Description|

|**docker run**| Run a container from a Docker image.|
|**docker start**| Start a stopped container.|
|**docker stop**| Stop a running container.|
|**docker pull**| Pull a Docker image from a registry (such as Docker Hub).|
|**docker push**| Push a Docker image to a registry.|
|**docker build**| Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.|

These are just a few examples of the many commands available in Docker. To see a complete list of Docker commands, you can use the **docker** command with the **--help** flag. For example: **docker --help**
